## Object-oriented chess engine.

### How to run.

This game uses Python 3.8 and Pygame 2.0. When testing, the main was called 
in IPython, so that might be the best console to use when running this game.
To run, open the chess_main.py file using Python or IPython in a command
prompt window. If your Python distribution is through conda, be sure to
have your conda environment activated before trying to load the main file.

### About
This game was designed for me to learn object oriented programming.  Since I 
know the rules to Chess, I figured I could build objects based on aspects of 
the game and make a working game from those objects.  I'm not sure if this is 
the most efficient way to make the game, but that isn't really the point of 
this exercise.

The chess_engine and chess_main were made following the YouTube tutorial by Eddie 
Sharick, found here:

and then modified to work with the objects that I created.  Unlike Eddie's program, 
this one uses objects as the pieces and board elements whereas his pieces and board 
are text and a list of lists, respectively.
