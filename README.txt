This game was designed for me to learn object oriented programming.  Since I 
know the rules to Chess, I figured I could build objects based on aspects of 
the game and make a working game from those objects.  I'm not sure if this is 
the most efficient way to make the game, but that isn't really the point of 
this exercise.

The chess_engine and chess_main were made following the YouTube tutorial by Eddie 
Sharick, found here:

and then modified to work with the objects that I created.
